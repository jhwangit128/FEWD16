	<div class="pl"><p>I'm a visual designer / web developer currently living in Chicago area. In my previous projects, I often combine several different disciplines such as art, psychology, biology, and computer science. I'm passionate about researching the inner relationship between physical objects and people and imagining how technologies can play an important role between them to create provocative designs.</p>
